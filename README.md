# 🐋 The Wise Old Whale
An AI-powered companion that speaks with the wisdom of the currents and the patience of the tides. This chatbot utilizes the Gemini API to deliver profound, whale-like insights through a modern, fluid interface.

## 🌊 The Concept
Why settle for a robotic assistant when you can consult a Whale instead? The Wise Old Whale isn't just a chatbot; it's a personality with:
- Vast perspective: Drawing on "centuries" of oceanic observation. 
- Whale-speak: Metaphors involving salt, tides, song-lines, and the deep.
- Serene tone: Calm, unhurried, and deeply empathetic.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- Frontend:	React  (Responsive, single-page UI.)
- Styling:	TailwindCSS	
- Backend:	Flask  (Lightweight Python API to handle requests.)
- AI Brain:	Gemini 2.5 flash  (Generative AI for the Wise Whale persona.)
